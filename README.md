# NOTEN | Your Online Notebook
'Noten' is an online notebook web application for creating and storing personal notes. This application was created as an individual project for a Computer Science class (CSC-324) at Grinnell College, Iowa. At this stage, there is limited functionality but I hope to improve the website sometime soon. I would like to thank Professor Barbara Johnson for assisting and guiding me in this project.

## Features
Tired of losing track of important information? Noten automatically saves notes online for you in one place for you to access.

Inspiration can strike anywhere! Use your mobile device to create notes and then view it later on your laptop.

View all your notes at once! Noten gives you the ability to view all the notes you have created in one place so you can quickly access any of them.

Outdated or incorrect information? Easily update or delete your note as required.


Start noting now!
